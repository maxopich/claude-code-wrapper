/**
 * Cluster I Phase H3 (UI_Findings spec §4.4): read the CURRENT on-disk content
 * of the file a bus mutation touched, for the `ArtifactsView` "▸ View latest
 * content" disclosure. The companion to `repo/search.ts` (C4) — both are the
 * pure(ish), Conn-free, unit-testable core that a thin WS executor delegates
 * to.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *   1. `redactArtifactContent` — apply the per-session-log redaction policy to
 *      a file body. No I/O; same input → same output.
 *   2. `readArtifactContent` — look the mutation up by id, resolve its file,
 *      read it TOCTOU-safely with a 1 MB cap, and redact. The only impure part;
 *      never throws (a disk error becomes an `error` field, not an exception).
 *
 * **Privacy posture (spec §3 + H3-3): redact-at-display.** We never persist a
 * redacted copy — we read the raw bytes from disk and mask on the way out.
 * There is NO raw/unredacted path for artifact previews (unlike C2 export and
 * C4 search): an artifact preview is always redacted, so there is no audit gate
 * here either.
 *
 * **Security (spec §4.4): TOCTOU-safe bounded read.** Delegated to
 * `safe_fs.readFilePrefixBounded`: open the path EXACTLY ONCE
 * (`O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK`), `fstat` the open fd (not the re-resolved path) to
 * reject non-regular files, and read a BOUNDED number of bytes from that SAME
 * descriptor. This closes the stat-then-read race (CodeQL js/file-system-race —
 * a malicious project can't swap the file for a symlink-to-secret between the
 * check and the read), the FIFO DoS (a pipe planted as the path can't block the
 * event loop), and the OOM a blind `readFileSync(fd)` would risk on a huge file.
 * This file hand-rolled that shape until `Cebab-x1n.6.21`; it was the only one
 * of the four copies that implemented it correctly, which is exactly why the
 * other three went unnoticed.

 *      iff the path is sensitive (the same sibling-masking rule the log view
 *      relies on).

 *      obvious inline credential (AWS key, `sk-…`, JWT, bearer / authorization
 *      header — `redactSensitive`'s value patterns). Masking line-by-line keeps
 *      an otherwise-readable file readable instead of blanking the whole body
 *      on a single match (which is what `redactSensitive` of the bare string
 *      would do — it masks the entire string value on any one pattern hit).
 *
 * Exported for direct unit testing.
